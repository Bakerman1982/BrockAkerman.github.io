<p>Hello and welcome to my website! I created this space to showcase my work and share thoughts on various topics through occasional lite-blogging. Here is a little about me...</p>

<p>My wife, Elizabeth, and I have been married for seven years, and we are blessed with five children. Both of us are the oldest of three children in our respective loving and humble upbringings. My father has worked with Coca-Cola for decades, transitioning from a technician role in the field to a corporate position. My mother held various secretarial jobs—including a role with the Federal Emergency Management Agency—before becoming a bus driver and eventually retiring. Elizabeth's father worked for AT&T in a call center, and her late mother served as an elementary school nurse. Elizabeth herself has a background in county emergency dispatch and recently completed her studies to become a surgical technologist.</p>

<p>I am a naturalized Floridian, having spent the majority of my youth in the Sunshine State. During my teenage years, I pursued a variety of interests. I was a high school football player, a participant in Karate, and an active member of the Y-Club, the JROTC drill team, and the JROTC rifle team. I also worked as a model, appearing in magazines and commercials for brands such as Hertz, Coppertone, Fisher-Price, and Ralph Lauren. Three weeks after graduating from high school, I shipped off to Parris Island, South Carolina, for United States Marine Corps Boot Camp.</p>

<p>Initially, I joined the Marine Corps Reserves to help offset the cost of college, but during the 11th week of boot camp, September 11th occurred, changing everything. After completing my training, I attended North Georgia College and State University while serving as an ordnanceman attached to MAG-42 at Naval Air Station Atlanta. I completed a tour in Afghanistan, where I earned a Combat Action Ribbon.</p>  

<p>In my twenties, I worked in the food service industry, holding positions at Chili's, Applebee's,d and The Olive Garden. These experiences provided valuable networking opportunities, which led to my first technical support role at the now-defunct Computer Resource Center. I advanced to a quality assurance associate role, testing software rollouts and documenting findings, before experiencing my first layoff after three years.</p>

<p>After some reflection, I decided to pursue a more stable career path and returned to school. I earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics with a minor in statistics from the University of North Georgia. I chose mathematics because of its versatility in problem-solving and studied Japanese to broaden my skills. My passion for statistics grew thanks to an inspiring professor, motivating me to continue my education. I am currently pursuing a Master’s in Statistics at North Carolina State University, with an expected graduation date of Summer 2025.</p>

<p>Professionally, I have spent the past eight years at Cardlytics, a financial technology firm specializing in advertising. I work with big data sourced from some of the largest banks in the United States and the United Kingdom, analyzing tens of millions of strings daily to uncover insights. While the work is engaging, I find myself drawn to opportunities that involve deeper applications of mathematics and statistics, which is why I am furthering my education in this field.</p> 

<p>Outside of work and academics, I enjoy attending church on Sundays, spending time with my family, playing piano, weightlifting, motorcycling, and working on the landscaping around my yard—yard chores have a therapeutic effect on me. After graduating from North Carolina State University, my first bucket list goal is to obtain a private pilot's license. I want to utilize statistics in my day job while I hope to use flight training for volunteer work in my personal time, either with the Civil Air Patrol or by helping families in need through Angel Flights.</p>
