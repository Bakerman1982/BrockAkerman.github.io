<body class>

<p>Hello and welcome to my website.  I designed this space to showcase my work and share my thoughts on various topic through occasional lite-blogging.</p>

<p>My professional background is inside the financial technology realm.  I have spent the last eight years working with big data sourced directly from some the United States and the United Kingdoms largest banks. Each day I parse tens of millions of strings looking for insights.</p>

<p>Academically I have been in school nearly as long as I have been working at Cardlytics.  I earned a bachelors degree in mathematics with a minor in statistics from the University of North Georgia.  I am on tract to graduating during the summer of 2025 with my masters in statistics from North Carolina State University.</p>

<p>In my youth; I played high school football, recreation street hockey, I was a member of the Y-club, the rifle team, and I was a model for well known brands like Ralph Lauren, Hertz, and Kodak.  I also played the based guitar for our church.</p>

<p>Post high school I joined the United States Marine Crops as an ordnanceman attached to anchor unit MAG-42 out of Naval Air Station Atlanta.  While there I completed a tour in Afghanistan where I was awarded a combat action ribbon.</p>
